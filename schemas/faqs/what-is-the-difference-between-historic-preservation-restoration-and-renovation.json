  "question": "What is the difference between historic preservation, restoration, and renovation?",
  "answer": "Historic preservation focuses on maintaining and repairing existing historic materials and retaining a property’s form as it has evolved over time. Historic restoration aims to return a building to a specific period, removing elements from other eras where appropriate. Renovation is more flexible and can include updating, altering, or reconfiguring spaces while still respecting key historic features."
