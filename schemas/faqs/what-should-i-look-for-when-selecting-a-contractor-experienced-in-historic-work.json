  "question": "What should I look for when selecting a contractor experienced in historic work?",
  "answer": "Look for a proven portfolio of historic projects, strong references from past clients, and familiarity with local preservation boards and building officials. A contractor who values careful investigation, mockups, and sample repairs is more likely to deliver sensitive, high-quality work."
